# ATM Machine Project (Python)

This is a simple ATM Machine simulation created using Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach.

##  What I Learned

As part of my learning today, I implemented:
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating ATM systems (`Atm` class).
- **Object**: An instance of the class (`Nic_Asia = Atm()`).
- **Constructor**: The `__init__()` method runs automatically when the object is created, initializing PIN and balance.
- **Methods**: Functions inside the class like `create_pin()`, `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, etc., that perform specific ATM operations.
- **Self**: Refers to the current object. It helps access or modify its own properties (like `self.pin` or `self.balance`).

This helped me understand how real-world concepts (like ATM machines) can be modeled using classes and objects.
